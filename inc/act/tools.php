<p>There are several Soldat tools that make creating and releasing your map easier. There are download links and information for these tools listed below for your convenience.</p>


<h4>Soldat MPA</h4>

<p>By VirtualTT &mdash;<br /> Soldat MPA is the best Soldat map archiver that is currently in existence. We highly reccomend using it, instead of other map packagers, as it doesn't skip needed files and is very fast. <a href="http://soldat.jrgp.org/file_download.php?id=29">Download</a> </p>

<h4>Soldat Polyworks</h4>

<p>By Anna &mdash;<br />  Currently the best mapping program that exists. <a href="http://soldat.jrgp.org/file_download.php?id=11">Download</a></p>
